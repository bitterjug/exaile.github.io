Exaile 0.3.2.1 is a bugfix release for 0.3.2. A short list of notable fixes:

*   The shoutcast plugin has been removed from the default install, as shoucast has changed their <span class="caps">API</span> and the new terms of service are not compatible with our license.
*   The default lyrics provider was changed to lyricwiki, as lyricfly no longer works properly.
*   A bug that prevented Exaile from running on very recent versions of pygobject was fixed.
*   A bug preventing files from being added via the <span class="caps">CLI</span> was fixed.
*   A [number of additional minor issues](https://launchpad.net/exaile/0.3.2/0.3.2.1) were resolved.
