---

Exaile 0.3.2.2 is a bugfix release for 0.3.2. Notable fixes include:

*   We are now capable of using the external bsddb3 module if distributions disable python2&#8217;s deprecated built-in bsddb support, as Arch Linux did recently.
*   Compatibility with newer Ex Falso releases was restored to the Ex Falso plugin.
*   Exaile no longer stops scanning when it encounters permissions errors
