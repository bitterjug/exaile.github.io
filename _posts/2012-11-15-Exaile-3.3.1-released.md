title: Exaile 3.3.1 Released!
---

The Exaile developers are happy to announce that Exaile 3.3.1 has been released!

### Highlights

*   Accessibility related fixes
*   Dynamic playlists are now working correctly
*   WMA files are properly supported now
*   Playlist import is now more robust
*   Internal tags (those starting with __) were clobbered when being restored to playlists, so things like ratings and other such things would disappear mysteriously. This is no longer the case.
*   Fixed plugins: ContextInfo, mini-mode, osd, last.fm

A source release + windows installer is available now at [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/exaile/+download).
