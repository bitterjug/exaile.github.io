title: Updated plugin development guide (and more!)
---

Exaile now has a [read the docs site](http://exaile.readthedocs.org)! The docs include API information, an updated plugin development guide, and user installation notes. A lot of information has been migrated + updated from synic's old bitbucket site for Exaile, and now lives with the Exaile source. We would love help updating this information, or any feedback you may have. Thanks!
