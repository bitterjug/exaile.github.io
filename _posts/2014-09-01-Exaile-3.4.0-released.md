title: Exaile 3.4 "we're not dead yet" released!
---

After a year of work and 60+ bugfixes and improvements, the Exaile developers are happy to announce that Exaile 3.4.0 "we're not dead yet" has been released!

### About the codename

Exaile has existed since 2006, and had a lot of rapid development until 2010 or so. At that point, development slowed down considerably, but since 2012 development has continued at a slow but steady rate. A number of you have asked whether the project is dead yet -- and the answer is a resounding **NO**. Exaile is a mature, stable audio player, and does much of what we want it to do, and does it well. The current development team uses Exaile on a regular basis, and will continue to add improvements and fix bugs as needed. To reflect this reality, the codename for this release is "we're not dead yet".
