title: Exaile 3.4.1 released!
---

For those of you wanting to use Exaile on OSX Mavericks or Yosemite, this release is for you! Prior releases of Exaile did not work properly because of font issues in GTK. This release contains workarounds for that.

There are other minor fixes too, check the commit log for details.
