title: Exaile 3.4.2 released (semi-critical bugfix release)
---

Fixes the following bugs:

* [#11](https://github.com/exaile-dev/exaile/issues/11) - Exaile did not always update individual files when changed externally
* [#12](https://github.com/exaile-dev/exaile/issues/12) - Add an option to 'force rescan' of files for users with misbehaving external tagger programs
* [#13](https://github.com/exaile-dev/exaile/issues/13) - GroupTagger plugin: Potential tag loss when using externally modified files

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release, particularly users of the GroupTagger plugin.
