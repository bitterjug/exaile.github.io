title: Exaile 3.4.3 released (translations update)
---

This is a significant translations update for Exaile, with close to 100% translations available now for several languages. If you would like to contribute to the Exaile translation effort, translation tools are now being generously hosted by [hosted weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/exaile/master/). 

Additionally, one minor bug was fixed:

* [#19](https://github.com/exaile/exaile/issues/19) - Smart Playlists with criteria involving timestamps do not work

Special thanks to @strebski for pointing out the translation problem, and providing a polish translation for Exaile. Additional thanks to the many translators who contributed to this release.
