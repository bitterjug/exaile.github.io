title: Exaile 3.4.4 released
---

The Exaile development team is happy to announce the latest release of Exaile. This release fixes the following bugs, and contains a number of translation updates as well:

* [#54](https://github.com/exaile/exaile/issues/54) - If you installed Exaile by makefile, or in slightly nonstandard ways, translations wouldn't actually work
* [Various minor bugs](https://github.com/exaile/exaile/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Exaile+3.4.4%22+is%3Aclosed)

And of course, you can look at the [commit log](https://github.com/exaile/exaile/compare/3.4.3...3.4.4) on github too.
