If you believe you have found a bug, you can click [here](https://github.com/exaile-dev/exaile/issues/new) to report it.  You will need to create a github account before you can post a bug report.

The following are ways you can get support or questions to answers you might have about using or developing Exaile:

**MAILING LISTS**

We run mailing lists for various purposes.

*   [exaile-users](http://groups.google.com/group/exaile-users) - A list for people who use Exaile. Open to discussion between users to communicate and help each other.  If you're having trouble using Exaile, ask here.

*   [exaile-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/exaile-devel) - Our primary list for general development discussion. Questions about the code, plugin development, packaging, etc. should go here.

**IRC**

Exaile developers can be reached on **#exaile** channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml). _Note: the channel is not very active, but if you stick around long enough someone will probably answer your question -- think in terms of email response time)_
